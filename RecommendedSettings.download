The reccommended setup for your FTP server is as follows:
1] Create two users. One for the administrator, one for the average user. Admin should have a stronger password.
2] Connect with either user, run the setup.
3] Block access to the average user for modifying contents of the folder Admin in the newly created CHAT folder.
4] Also Block access to the folder Mods.
5] From there on you can set up the rest from inside the chat program.

RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR CHAT SERVER:
- No connection limit
- No Connection count limit
- Bandwidth restriction if you don't trust all the users.
- At least 1GB of storage, you'll probably want at least 16 GB if you plan on using the file sharing portion a lot.
